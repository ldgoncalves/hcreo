        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Hispanic Council for Reform and Educational Options (Hispanic CREO) was founded in 2001 by a group of passionate Hispanics who believed that parents had a right to understand the educational options available to them. Hispanic CREO created coalitions and partnerships with parents, schools, faith-based organizations, advocates and like-minded groups, to be the voice of the Hispanic people in education reform. Throughout the years, Hispanic CREO has educated, informed, and mobilized Hispanic parents around numerous school choice issues.</p>
        <p>Research shows that Hispanics are the most uneducated minority group in the U.S. There is a growing crisis in Hispanic student achievement, Hispanic CREO is the only national public policy Hispanic organization dedicated solely to K-12 education reform and willing to speak on behalf of parents and children. Hispanic CREO plays a critical role as the conduit between the education reform community, business community, press, policy makers and Hispanic families.</p>
        <p>Through outreach efforts, mobilization, and communications, Hispanic CREO seeks to empower and mobilize the Hispanic community to action. Hispanic CREO has achieved the following successes in its history:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hispanic CREO has assisted more than 2,000 families obtain a scholarship.</li>
            <li>In 2013, Hispanic CREO successfully launched the Futuro2020 campaign that today has over 3,500 social media followers.</li>
            <li>In 2012, Hispanic CREO had over 100% vote support from the entire Hispanic Caucus in Florida for expansion of Scholarship Program.</li>
            <li>In 2011, Hispanic CREO assisted in putting together the largest School Choice Rally with over 7,500 parents, students and partner organizations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hispanic CREO broad scope address choices in not only private schools,  but also charter, online and traditional public schools allowing it to reach more families, ensuring that we live in an America where all children receive a world-class education.</p>
